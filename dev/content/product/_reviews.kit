                    I have used the glowforge for 8 months; I have used customer service and they were great. I can only say great things about glowforge! BUT…be vigilant about cleaning your machine…learn all you can about the operation of it and then just have some fun!

                    Love the Glowforge Pro. Without even being aggressive we managed to pay it off in one year by simply supplementing my wife's existing business.It is very user friendly and would recommend it to all my friends and family.

                    Works great , easy to use once you've learned to navigate through the software. Glowforge community is very helpful. Haven't been able to use it to its fullest potential yet but my little creations sell fast.

                    Year one with our Glowforge Pro and fortunately we haven’t had any problems that we couldn’t solve by googling the issue or checking the website.
